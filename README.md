## fjs
Helper library to make functional programming in JS easier.

Inspired by underscore.js, culljs, prelude.ls and other sources.

**This is a work in progress**

## Usage
Still in development

## Development
To get the dependencies do a `npm install`

Source is on the `src` folder.

Tests on the `test` folder.

Make actions:
* Compile: `make compile`
* Test: `make test`
* Tests watcher: `make test-w`

On the folder `docs` there are pdfs of the three sites that I want to use as
inspiration.
